# 🌡️ Sensor Data Forecasting with IoT Temperature & Humidity Data

## 🔍 Introduction

In the era of smart homes, weather-aware agriculture, and industrial IoT systems, vast amounts of **sensor data** are generated every minute. Among the most common and valuable sensor readings are **temperature** and **humidity** — environmental factors that impact everything from human comfort to device behavior.

This project started as an exploration:  
**Can we use historical sensor data to predict future environmental conditions?**  
Turns out — **yes, and quite effectively!**

## 📊 About the Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a real-world IoT dataset, publicly available on Kaggle. It contains **timestamped readings of temperature and humidity** recorded at regular intervals. These kinds of datasets simulate how an IoT system — like a weather station, greenhouse monitor, or HVAC system — collects and logs data over time.

### 🧾 Dataset Columns:
- `datetime`: The timestamp of each reading
- `temperature`: Recorded temperature in Celsius (°C)
- `humidity`: Relative humidity percentage (%)

You can imagine this data being collected by a DHT11 sensor connected to an Arduino or Raspberry Pi.

## 📌 Project Goals

- ⏱️ **Understand the structure** of IoT sensor data  
- 📈 **Visualize trends** in temperature and humidity over time  
- 🧹 **Clean and preprocess** the data for modeling  
- 🤖 **Forecast future readings** using time-series techniques  
- 📉 **Interpret the results** and see how accurate our models can be

This project is designed not just to build a model, but to walk through the thought process of **making IoT data useful and actionable**.

## 🧪 What’s Inside the Notebook?

The Jupyter notebook includes step-by-step explanations and code for the entire workflow.

### 🧰 Key Steps Covered:
1. **Loading the dataset**
2. **Parsing timestamps** and setting up a time-series index
3. **Visualizing temperature and humidity trends**
4. **Handling missing data**
5. **Creating forecasting models** using statistical techniques (expandable to ML)
6. **Predicting future values** and plotting them
7. **Reflecting on what worked and what could be improved**

## 🧠 Why This Project Matters

IoT is more than just sensors and signals. The **value lies in the insights** we extract from the raw data.

- 🌾 In agriculture: predicting humidity helps automate irrigation
- 🏡 In smart homes: forecasting temperature can optimize energy usage
- 🏭 In industries: anomaly detection in sensor readings can prevent costly failures

By turning historical data into **future insights**, we enable better **automation, efficiency, and decision-making**.
